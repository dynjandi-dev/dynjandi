# AI Engineering Standards

Personal AI-native engineering standards for TypeScript and React projects. Optimized for AI agent consumption while remaining readable for humans.

**Source:** `https://github.com/baldurpan/ai-engineering-standards`

**Primary stack:** TypeScript on Node.js, React on the frontend. All standards in `philosophy/`, `typescript/`, `react/`, `architecture/`, `tooling/`, and `security/` apply to this stack.

**Secondary stack:** PHP, supported in [`php/`](php/), only when the task is explicitly PHP. Do not suggest PHP for a new project, a Node-friendly task, or a TypeScript codebase.

## For Humans — How to Use This Repo

In your project, create an `AGENTS.md` that references this repo:

```md
# AGENTS.md

This project follows [AI Engineering Standards](https://github.com/baldurpan/ai-engineering-standards).
Load that repo's `README.md` and follow its conditional-loading guidance.

## Project / Stack / Commands
[your project-specific content]
```

Copy [`templates/AGENTS.md`](templates/AGENTS.md) as a starting point. Optionally add a `CLAUDE.md` that points at your `AGENTS.md` ([`templates/CLAUDE.md`](templates/CLAUDE.md)).

Everything below this line is for the AI agent.

### Repository Map

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`philosophy/`](philosophy/) | Core principles and AI agent behavior rules |

| [`php/`](php/) | **Secondary stack.** PHP standards — only when the task is explicitly PHP |

### Core Philosophy

> Prefer explicit, composable, feature-oriented architecture over generalized abstractions and centralized complexity.

See [`philosophy/core-principles.md`](philosophy/core-principles.md) for the full architectural values.

### Documentation Style

All docs are directive and concise. Expect:
- `## DO` / `## DO NOT` / `## PRIORITY` sections
- Side-by-side good and bad code examples
- Hierarchical headings, no prose essays
- Cross-references via relative links
